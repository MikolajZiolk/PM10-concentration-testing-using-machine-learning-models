This repository is a fork of a group project completed as part of the course "Remote Repositories and Version Control Systems in Machine Learning Projects." The project was developed collaboratively within an organization and explores best practices for managing machine learning workflows with version control systems like Git.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own machine learning projects.
